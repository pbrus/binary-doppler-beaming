# Binary-doppler-beaming
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pbrus/binary-doppler-beaming.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pbrus/binary-doppler-beaming) [![Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/code-Python-blue.svg "Python")](https://www.python.org/) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-yellow.svg "MIT license")](https://github.com/pbrus/binary-doppler-beaming/blob/master/LICENSE)

This software generates a light curve of a binary system which is caused by the photometric beaming. For more details see [arXiv:0708.2100](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0708.2100.pdf). You can set up any configuration of a binary system seen from Earth.

## Installation

The software was written in *Python 3.4*. To install it, please type from the command line:
```bash
$ sudo pip3 install bidobe
```
or alternatively:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/pbrus/binary-doppler-beaming
$ cd binary-doppler-beaming
$ sudo python3 setup.py install
```
Additionally the software uses the following modules:

 * *numpy*
 * *scipy*
 * *matplotlib*

They can be easily installed too. Please run:
```bash
$ sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

All you need are the `doppler_beaming.py` script and the `binary.conf` file. Edit the last one and configure your own binary system (see comments inside this file to find out which units are used):
```python
[OBJECTS]
mass1 = 1
mass2 = 2
temperature1 = 6000
temperature2 = 8000
radius1 = 1.0
radius2 = 1.5
distance = 1000

[ORBITS]
sum_major_axis = 8e10
eccentricity = 0.4
longitude_node = 70.0
inclination = 60.0
periastron_argument = 110.0
...
```
Now you can run the `doppler_beaming.py`:
```bash
$ python3 doppler_beaming.py
```
The main module *bidobe* (**bi**nary **do**ppler **be**aming) provides the interface to display, save to files and animate orbits, radial velocities and light curves. Moreover, it allows to convert [SI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units) units from and to astronomical units. For example:
```python
orbit1_position = orbit1.convert_m_to_au(orbit1_position)
```
converts position in meters to position in [AU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit)s. The following commands:
```python
plot_projected_orbits(orbit1_position, orbit2_position, "AU", "AU")
plot_projected_orbits(orbit1_position, orbit2_position, "AU", "AU", "orbits.eps")
animate_projected_orbits(orbit1_position, orbit2_position, "AU", "AU")
```
can be used to display orbits projected on the sky, save them to *orbits.eps* file and animate them on the screen, respectively.
